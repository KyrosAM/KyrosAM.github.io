            In September 2019, my freshman year, I was hired by Maryland Atheletics to photograph the sports teams
            throughout their seasons. The photos were
            used for Maryland websites, twitter, instagram, etc.
            <br></br> Here are a few examples:<br></br>

                    Powerful Poet</a>
                <br></br>
                Nikon just released their winning images for their 2020-21 photo contest <a
                    href="https://www.nikon-photocontest.com/en/">(nikonphotocontest)</a> and
                to say that I was absolutely
                shocked to see my photo chosen is an understatement.
                This photo was taken in Astoria Park during one of the Black Lives Matter marches last year. It was the
                first one I had gone to.
                After a small march, everyone gathered around to listen to individuals share their stories and thoughts
                with the crowd.
                •
                There’s plenty to be said on the matter, you can see some of my thoughts in previous posts and possibly
                more on the Nikon photo contest
                site later on. But overall, this image came about because of a movement to combat racial injustice in
                our country. It is important to remember
                that even though this photo was taken a year ago, and weekly marches have ended,
                the systemic issues remain.
