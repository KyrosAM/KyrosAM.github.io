        <p>Despite being a team sport, some NBA teams rely on a star to get them to the
            finals more than others. Did Giannis do it without help? <em>Not really.</em> 
            Did MJ carry Pippen? <em>Sometimes.</em> Is LeBron amazing? <em>Yes</em>.</p>
        
        <p>There are plenty of opinionated articles and videos debating this already. 
            So I figured I would add my data-driven take to the mix. What do the data say 
            about ranking the biggest Finals carry jobs in NBA history?</p>
        
        <p>The data say that LeBron’s (losing) effort with the 2018 Cavaliers 
            reigns supreme.</p>

        <mark>Advanced stat haters should stop reading.</mark

        <!--ADD LINKS TO GRAF BELOW-->
        <p>To answer this I used the all-in-one advanced stat <a href = ' https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-raptor-metric-works/
        538: https://fivethirtyeight.com/'>RAPTOR WAR (WAR)</a> created by 538,
        a good measure for how many wins a player contributed vs. what a replacement level
        player would. But we can’t just measure who had the highest WAR in isolation since
        both games and minutes played factor in. It needs to be relative to the rest of 
        the team.</p>
    </div>

    <div id = blockTwo>
        <p>This chart shows a player's WAR in the playoffs vs. their minutes played for every team in the
        NBA finals since 1997. Players with more uniform impact are clustered closer together, and those
        with standout performances are higher and more separated.</p>


        <p>
        The <span style="background-color: black; color:white">2005 pistos</span> represents the "no 'I' in team" philosophy.<br><br>
        The <span style="background-color: black; color:white">1998 Bulls</span> and the <span style="background-color: black; color:white">2020 Lakers</span> are prime examples of a
        dynamic duo.<br><br>
        And finally we have Duncan leading the <span style="background-color: black; color:white">2003 Spurs</span>, Wade with 
        <span style="background-color: black; color:white">2006 Heat</span>, and LeBron basically every year, but notably with the 
        <span style="background-color: black; color:white">2018 Cavs</span> representing the single-handed carry jobs.</p>
        <br>

    </div>


    <div id = blockThree>
        <p>To rank the biggest carry jobs, I decided to look at the WAR
        share among the top three players on a team. I could’ve picked 
        any number of players to compare, but most great teams have at least two or three 
        stars, with the rest filling in as role players, so three is the magic number.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- GRAPHICS TEXT BELOW -->
    
    <ul id = 'chartBlock'> 
        <li class = capStyl>Wade tops the list for finals winners, carrying the load with an aging Shaq</li>

    </ul>

<div id = 'blockThree'>
    <p>To summarize: the data say that LeBron is Mr. Playoffs, and some of the most epic
    carry jobs were done by finals losers, who maybe just needed one more piece to 
    the puzzle to win it all. But mostly, this is another perspective to add to 
    these on-going debates.</p>

        <!--FOOTER TEXT-->

    <p>Data for this story came from 538. The analysis only included players with 
    150+ minutes played. There are a lot of metrics out there, and they can all be 
    great and terrible. Quantity matters in the playoffs, so a cumulative stat was 
    chosen.</p>
