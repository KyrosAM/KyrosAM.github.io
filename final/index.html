        <p>
            For the last 20 months, the Covid-19 pandemic has had some impact on the lives of every person, one way or
            another.
            For students all over the United States, their education continued online until eventually falling back to
            in-person or hybrid classes.
            However, for many students, the pandemic was an obstacle that could not be overcome. <br> The number of high
            school and college dropouts
            rose along with the drop in college enrollment.
            Some students opted not to enter the college system at all.

            When classes resumed in the fall, 2021 data shows that <strong>25% of students</strong> decided to postpone
            their college experience during the pandemic.
            This is a worrying number as these are students who started their college
            careers and decided that it was going to be difficult to continue. Many of these students hail from
            low-income
            households.

                A Washington post article dives into the life of one particular student who was the first to make it to
                college in her family.
                Online instruction forced Paige McConnell out of school as she had to means of attending. Her house had
                no Wi-Fi and public spaces such as libraries were closed.
                She was not the only one going through this. The chat details the number of students who had to postpone
                their education and why.

    <p> Based on this data, millions of students are unable to pay for their college education due to financial
        changes, such as job loss, as a result of the pandemic.
        Over 3.5 million students must take the roll of the caretaker after a
        relative either contracted the virus or their previous care arrangements changed for the worse. Of all the
        students surveyed,
        the overall numbers show that more students had to cancel their college plans than those who plan to
        continue their education. </p>

                One student, Natalia Cruze,(pictured with her nephew who she sometimes takes care of) shared
                that her
                college education took a direct hit from the pandemic.
                <br>
                “I was working a part-time job in the city while also trying to be a student up in Harlem. That
                itself is hard already, you know.”
                <br>
                The lifestyle, while difficult, was working out for Cruze up until the pandemic caused her to
                lose her job.
                <br>
                “Sometime in March, my boss told me I had to go, and I did not really have other places to work.
                Rent got expensive and school was a burden I couldn’t mentally handle or even pay for at the
                time, so I left.”

                    Enrollment into college has decreased at all types of institutions at the undergraduate
                    level since 2019 as well. The chart shows the overall decrease in enrollment from 2019 to
                    2021. Overall, the undergraduate enrollment has seen <strong>-7.8% decrease </strong>from fall
                    2019 to fall
                    2021.

        <div>

            Breaking down the data shows that all schools, public, private, 4-year, and 2-year colleges have seen a
            decrease. That being said, 2-year colleges, which are mainly community colleges where many low-income
            students attend, were hit the hardest. From 2019-2021 public 2-year colleges have seen a
            <strong>-14.8%</strong>
            decrease.
