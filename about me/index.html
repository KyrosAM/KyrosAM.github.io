Hello! My name, as you may have realized, is Kyros. 
I am a Queens, NYC native who is currently studying journalism at the University of Maryland. <br> </br>

My love for photography started in the 5th grade during spring break, when I went to take photos of wildlife with my uncle.
He taught me the basics of his Canon t3 and sent me off to see what I could capture. 
It wasn't until freshman year of high school that I purchased my own camera in preperation for my trip to Greece in the summer. 
Ever since then, I have been in love with photography and I try to take my camera with me where ever I go.<br></br>
Over the last couple of years I have shot several events ranging from prom photos to professional soccer matches. 
If you'd like to learn more about what I've done, check my clips page and resume page below.
